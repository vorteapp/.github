## 👋 Welcome

### Our mission as developers of Vorte
Vorte is about making office tasks genuinely easier through an intuitive UI and reliable automation on a platform you can trust to respect your privacy.

Our direction is future-focused: to give maximum leverage to new entrepreneurs and to established businesses ready to change how digital work is done.

We are moving toward an offline-first, cross-platform UI, paired with a **zero-knowledge cloud service** and a **verifiable, per-resource IAM and collaboration system**. This evolving foundation is what will power Vorte end to end.

On top of it, we are shaping customer-facing tools **with Finnish entrepreneurs and businesses in mind**. The goal is demanding but clear: remove as many ground-level frictions as possible through intuitive design and genuinely high-quality UX.
