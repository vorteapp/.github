## 👋 Welcome

### Our mission as developers of Vorte
Vorte is about making office tasks genuinely easier through an intuitive UI and reliable automation on a platform you can trust to respect your privacy.

 We want to give maximum leverage to new entrepreneurs and to established businesses ready to change how digital work is done.

Right now we are working toward an offline-first, cross-platform frontend, paired with a **zero-knowledge cloud service** and a **verifiable, per-resource IAM and collaboration system**. This evolving foundation is what will power Vorte end to end.

On top of it, we are shaping customer-facing tools **with Finnish entrepreneurs and businesses in mind**. The goal is demanding but clear: remove as many ground-level frictions as possible through intuitive design and genuinely high-quality UX.
