## 👋 Welcome

### Our mission
Vorte is on a path to solve the **trust challenge of running your mission online from day one**.

Our direction is future-focused: to give maximum leverage to new entrepreneurs and to experienced builders who are ready to change how digital work is done.

We are moving toward an abstract, offline-first, cross-platform UI, paired with a **zero-knowledge cloud service** and a **verifiable, per-resource IAM and collaboration system**. This evolving foundation is what will power Vorte end to end.

On top of it, we are shaping customer-facing tools **with Finnish entrepreneurs and businesses in mind**. The goal is demanding but clear: remove as many ground-level frictions as possible through intuitive design and genuinely high-quality UX.

With transparent and affordable pricing, Vorte is meant to remain accessible to anyone interested in entrepreneurship. Our long-term ambition is to become **Finland’s leading privacy-preserving collaborative platform for the entire workforce**.

## You might be the right developer to join our mission if you:

- **Foundational Web Standards**  
  Are fluent in HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript, and prefer native browser APIs over unnecessary abstractions.

- **Modern UI Development**  
  Have hands-on experience with Svelte and value compiler-driven, high-performance reactive interfaces.

- **Data-Oriented Thinking**  
  Design systems around structured data, clear information flow, and intentional architecture rather than ad hoc solutions.

- **Professional Documentation Practices**  
  Care about long-term maintainability, use JSDoc, and rely on tools like IntelliCode to keep intent explicit.

- **Web-Native Applications (PWA)**  
  Understand cross-platform PWAs and are interested in how service workers and manifests enable installable, resilient apps.

- **Cloudflare Infrastructure**  
  Have basic familiarity with Cloudflare and are curious about deploying privacy-aware applications at the edge.
