# Hi there 👋

### You might be the right developer to join our mission if:

* **Foundational Web Standards** – You have a solid grasp of [HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), with an interest in using native browser APIs to write clean, efficient logic.
* **Modern UI Development** – You’ve had exposure to [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and its compiler-based approach to building reactive, high-performance user interfaces.
* **Data-Driven Logic** – You prefer a programmatic approach to managing and manipulating structured data, focusing on how information flows through an application.
* **Professional Documentation** – You value maintainable code and use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) alongside tools like IntelliCode to ensure your logic is well-documented and easy to follow.
* **Web-Native Apps (PWA)** – You understand the concepts behind [Cross-Platform PWAs](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) and want to learn how service workers and manifests create installable mobile experiences.
* **Cloudflare Infrastructure** – You have a basic understanding of [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for hosting and are curious about deploying applications to the edge.
